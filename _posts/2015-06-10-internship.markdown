My University require every student to take an internship in between the second and the third end of year holidays. First internship placement were choosen by university, i was placed in [BPJS Kesehatan](https://bpjs-kesehatan.go.id/bpjs/) in Banda Aceh. The second one was one of smaller devloping bussiness of own, their business was in beauty clinic. Since there is no IT departement here I was tasked to resolve every single IT problem the clinic had at that moment. From fixing and updating their POS software to installing attendance machine. Althou there is not much to learn acedemically speaking. this program helps student to learn and familiarize themselves on workplace and environment organizational chain of command.
